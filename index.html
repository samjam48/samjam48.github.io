            <h2>About Sam</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                I am Sam Harris. An entrepreneur and podcaster. I launched my first social enterprise, Pedal Power Transport at 20 which I grew for 4 years creating healthy jobs and reducing pollution in the City of Bristol.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ran the Bristol Universities business accelerator for a year and have since travelled the world and worked in various start ups in psychology, marketing and healthcare.
            </p>
            <h3> Current </h3>
            <p>
                I run the <a href="https://www.growthmindsetpodcast.com">Growth Mindset Podcast</a> for curious listeners wanting to learn more about the world around them and the world within them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve interviewed fascinating individuals from billionaires to actual hitmen to find how motivations and decisions influence our outcomes.

            <h2>Why Apply?</h2>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                I am applying to the <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com">Founders and Coders</a> Programme because it is the best immersive education in programming available. I enjoy coding and making things work as much as I enjoy working with others and building things together.
            </p>
            <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>
                Besides the great coding education the biggest attraction to Founders and Coders for me is the community. A group of great students excited to learn together and help each other. I have a number of start up ideas I want to work on after the course and hope to find potential cofounders to work with.
            </p>
            <h3>Give Back</h3>
            <p>
                I think the F and C scheme is fantastic and I’d love to be a part of it. I strongly believe in empowering others to improve their situation and think help to give back and make it grow.
